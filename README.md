# MPCCForHearingLoss
This project creates a hearing loss and hearing aid simulator using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). It simulates the experience of hearing loss by attenuating audio at different frequencies and demonstrates how hearing aids amplify sound to compensate for the loss, helping users understand the impact of hearing impairment.
